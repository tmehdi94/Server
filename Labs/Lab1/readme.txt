Lab 1

Readme:

In this lab, Javascript and jQuery were used to parse a JSON file containing information regarding tweets. Once the data was parsed,
and stored in arrays, I initially output the first five elements from the tweets and hashtags. Then after every 3 seconds, function
whoathere was called, which removes the last li element and gets a new li element which is the next element in each array, and prepends
it to each ul element.

HTML5 was used for structure; semantic tags such as header and section are used.

CSS was used to style the output. http://snipplr.com/view/52286/different-css-dropshadows/ was referenced to accomplish the drop shadow
effect.
